# ProsperLoans-Visualization

This visualization shows the credit crunch of the financial crisis and its effect in the loan default ratio using Prosper Loans data.
In loans originated from 2007 to 2013, the average credit score increases to a peak in 2009, then slighly decreases to 2013. Meanwhile, the average default ratio starts at almost 50% for loans originated in 2007 and sharply decreases to its lowest for loans originated in 2009.

## Design

The visualization shows two time series represented as line charts with the loan origination year as the x-axis: one showing the average credit score and the other showing the default ratio. Emphasis is given to the year 2009, when Prosper Loans tightened credit to new originations, resulting in the reduced proportion of loans in default. 

Interactivity: show credit score and default ratio for each Proper Loan credit rating.
